### Hey, I'm Yuliia ðŸ‘‹  

![My Image](https://github.com/YuliiaZaharia/YuliiaZaharia/blob/48322f911474d8f135437d60a7efc0164b433db7/header-github.png)

I am a web developer, computer science and interface design student with experience in building and designing websites and apps, including basic landing pages and sophisticated web solutions. In addition to making software run smoothly, my target is to design user interfaces that are pixel-perfect and intuitive. I adore discovering new and improved techniques for using readable, scalable, and efficient code to produce flawless user experiences. I see my job as a continuous learning process, and I'm looking for chances to collaborate with people who are equally inspired by innovative and functional web experiences for better future. My main target is to work with people who bring out the best in me to develop something useful at the end of the day.
